indexes:

# Note: (mw 2010-01-26)
# Since PROPFIND is blocked by the SDK, we can only test online.
# Therefore the indices may not be automatically updated!
# When missing, add this:
#- kind: Chunk
#  properties:
#  - name: file
#  - name: offset
#
#- kind: Path
#  properties:
#  - name: parent_path
#  - name: offset

# AUTOGENERATED

# This index.yaml is automatically updated whenever the dev_appserver
# detects that a new type of query is run.  If you want to manage the
# index.yaml file manually, remove the above marker line (the line
# saying "# AUTOGENERATED").  If you want to manage some indexes
# manually, move them above the marker line.  The index.yaml file is
# automatically uploaded to the admin console when you next deploy
# your application using appcfg.py.
